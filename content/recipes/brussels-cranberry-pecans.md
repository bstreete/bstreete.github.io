**Note:** Recommend steaming the brussel sprouts before browning in the pan. This drastically cuts down on required cooking time. 

**Note:** I typically combine all of the ingredients in the pan rather than a separate bowl to melt the cheese. 

### Ingredients

- 1 pound brussels sprouts, de-stemed and halved
- 1/2 cup dried cranberries
- 1/3 cup gorgonzola cheese, crumbled
- 1/3 cup pecans
- 1/2 cup barley (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt & pepper

### Directions
1. Prepare barley according to package instructions.
1. Heat brussels sprouts and olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Season with salt & pepper. Cook for 7-9 minutes.
1. Add balsamic vinegar and maple syrup. Stir to coat and remove from heat.
1. Toss barley, sprouts, cranberries, and pecans in a large bowl.
1. Top with gorgonzola.

### Ingredients
#### Salad
- Medium bunch of kale (best with Lacinto aka 'Dinosaur' kale)
- 1/2 cup pecan or walnut pieces
- 1/2 cup dried cherries or cranberries
- 1/4 cup queso fresco or soft goat cheese
- 1/2 cup Mustard Vinaigrette

#### Mustard Vinaigrette Dressing
- 1/2 small red onion, chopped finely (roughly 1/4 cup)
- 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 2/3 cup olive oil

### Directions
#### Salad
1. Wash kale and pat dry. 
2. Remove center rib from kale with a knife or by tearing with your hands. Discard stems. Tear or cut kale leaves into small, bite-sized pieces. 
3. In a large bowl, combine kale, nuts, dried fruit, and cheese.
4. Toss salad with mustard vinaigrette. 
5. Serve immediately or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days. 

#### Mustard Vinaigrette Dressing
1. Combine all ingredients in a clean jar (like a mason jar or spaghetti sauce jar). Place lid on jar and shake vigorously until ingredients are well combined.
2. Serve immediately and refrigerate unused portion for up to 1 week. 

Note: The olive oil will clump up when refrigerated. Take the dressing out of the fridge 10 to 15 minutes prior to serving.

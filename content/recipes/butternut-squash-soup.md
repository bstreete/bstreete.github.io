### Ingredients
- 1 Large (2 to 3 pound) butternut squash
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 onion, roughly chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
- 3 garlic cloves, roasted
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1/4 cup toasted pumpkin seeds (optional)

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Line or grease a baking sheet. 
2. Cut the squash in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. Place on the baking sheet, brush with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until tender. Remove from oven and let it cool slightly. Scoop out the flesh. 
3. In a large pan over medium heat, saute onion until soft. Add chopped sage and saute for another minute. 
4. Add roasted squash, garlic, and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil and then simmer for about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly. 
5. Pour into a blender, and process until smooth. Alternatively, use an immersion blender. 
6. Serve in bowls, garnished with pumpkin seeds.

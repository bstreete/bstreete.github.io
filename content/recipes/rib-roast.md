### Ingredients
- 2 pounds cross-rib roast
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

### Directions
1. Brush roast with balsamic vinegar. 
2. Make a paste with remaining ingredients and apply to meat.
3. Roast meat at 450 for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 and cook for 40 to 60 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 125. 
1. Remove from oven; cover loosely with foil and let stand 15 to 25 minutes. 

Note: This results in a well done roast. For a more rare roast, cook until an internal temp of 120.

#### Notes
This is a modified version of the original recipe. The chili recipe associated with the cornbread was omitted as I prefer a [different chili recipe](../meaty-beany-chili). The cornbread is quite tasty, but can be cooked independently. 

Cornbread goes great with honey and/or butter. 

### Ingredients
- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup sugar 
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt 
- 1 cup milk 
- 1 large egg 
- 1/4 cup cooking oil

### Directions

Instructions

1. Begin to preheat the oven to 425ÂºF. In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until very well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and oil. Pour the milk mixture into the bowl with the cornmeal mixture and stir just until everything is moistened.
1. Pour the mixture into the oiled skillet. 
1. Transfer the skillet to the fully preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes, or until the cornbread is golden brown on the surface.

### Ingredients
- 1 pre-cooked ham, ~7-9 lbs
- 2 L Coca-Cola
- 2 L ginger ale (__not__ diet)
- 1 large can pineapple juice or concentrate (~1 L) 
- 1 large chunk ginger root, peeled and sliced
- dijon-style mustard
- maraschino cherries
- whole pineapple rings
- whole cloves

### Directions
1. Place ham in large stockpot. Add Coca-Cola, ginger ale, and ~3/4 of the pineapple juice until ham is fully submerged.
1. Bring to a boil.
1. Reduce heat to a simmer, continue cooking for 2-3 hours.
1. Turn off heat, cover pot, and let sit overnight (approximately 6 hours).
1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Remove ham from liquid and drain. 
1. Make glaze by combining mustard, remaining pineapple juice, brown sugar, and dry mustard. Mix until dry mustard is well incorporated and brown sugar is dissolved.
1. Score ham in a grid across fatty sections. Place cloves into score marks. 
1. Decorate ham with pineapple rings and cherries. Brush glaze over ham & fruit. 
1. Bake ham for 1 1/2 hours (bone-in), brushing with glaze periodically. This is basically to bring the hame back up to  temperature, so you may need less time for a boneless ham.

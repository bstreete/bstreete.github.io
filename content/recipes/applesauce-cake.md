#### Notes
Can substitute green chile applesauce for the regular applesauce for a delicious New Mexican style dessert. 

### Ingredients
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 4 eggs
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
- 2 cups applesauce
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Set aside.
1. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, sugar, oil, applesauce and vanilla. Mix well and pour into prepared pan.
1. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.

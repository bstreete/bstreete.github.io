#### Notes
Recommend topping with some combination of the following: 
- sliced avocado
- tortilla chips
- sour cream
- Tony's Cajun seasoning

### Ingredients
- 2 cloves garlic 
- 1 medium onion 
- 2 stalks celery 
- 2 medium carrots
- 1 lb dry uncooked black beans
- 1 cup salsa 
- 1 Tbsp chili powder
- 1/2 Tbsp cumin 
- 1 tsp oregano 
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 2 cups water

### Directions
1. Mince the garlic, dice the onion and celery, and grate the carrots on a large holed cheese grater. Rinse the black beans in a colander under cool running water and pick out any stones or debris.
1. Combine the garlic, onion, celery, carrots, black beans, salsa, chili powder, cumin, oregano, vegetable broth, and water in a 5-7 quart slow cooker. Stir well.
1. Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on high for 6-8 hours (you want the beans to get VERY soft). Once the beans are very soft, use an immersion blender to blend the soup until it is thick and creamy (leave some beans whole if desired). **Strongly recommend using an immersion blender instead of a countertop blender for safety.** Taste the soup and add salt if needed (this will depend on the brand of vegetable broth used).

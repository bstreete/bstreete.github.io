### Ingredients
Can substitute the peanut sauce with crushed peanuts and some sriracha to save time. 

#### Peanut Sauce
- 1/4 cup natural-style peanut butter 
- 1 Tbsp sriracha
- 1 tsp soy sauce 
- 1 tsp grated fresh ginger 
- 1 tsp brown sugar 
- 3 Tbsp hot water 
#### Pork and Vegetable Mix
- 1/2 Tbsp neutral cooking oil
- 2 cloves garlic 
- 1 tsp grated fresh ginger
- 1/2 lb ground pork, chicken or turkey 
- 8 oz button mushrooms 
- 1 large carrot 
- 1 red bell pepper 
- 1/3 cup hoisin sauce 
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce 
- 1 tsp toasted sesame oil 

#### Bowl Ingredients
- 4 cups cooked rice $0.88
- 1/4 cup peanuts, chopped
- 2-3 green onions, sliced

### Directions
1. Mix the spicy peanut sauce first to allow the flavors time to blend. In a small bowl, combine the peanut butter, sriracha, soy sauce, brown sugar, and grated fresh ginger (use a small holed-cheese grater to grate about 1 tsp). Stir in one tablespoon of hot water at a time until the sauce is thin enough to drizzle. Set the sauce aside.
1. Mince the garlic and grate another teaspoon of fresh ginger. Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet over medium flame. Add the garlic and ginger to the hot skillet and sauté for about one minute, or just until the garlic is softened. Add the pork and continue to sauté until the pork is cooked through and crumbled (about five minutes).
1. While the pork is cooking, rinse the mushrooms then chop them into small pieces. Once the pork is cooked through, add the chopped mushrooms and continue to sauté until the mushrooms have wilted and released all their moisture (about five minutes).
1. While the mushrooms are cooking, peel the carrot then shred it using a large-holed cheese grater. Finely dice the red bell pepper. Once the mushrooms have cooked down, add the shredded carrot, diced bell pepper, hoisin sauce, toasted sesame oil, and soy sauce to the skillet. Stir and cook until everything is coated in sauce and heated through. (The amount of soy sauce needed may vary depending on the brand of hoisin sauce used. Start with 1/2 Tbsp and add more to taste).
1. To build the bowls, start with one cup cooked rice, then add 3/4-1 cup of the meat and vegetable mixture. Sprinkle a few sliced green onions on top, then drizzle 1-2 Tbsp of the spicy peanut sauce over everything. Finish with about 1 Tbsp of the chopped peanuts.

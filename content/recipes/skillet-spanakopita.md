Taken from **How to Cook Everything Fast**, page 468-469

### Ingredients

- 10 to 12 sheets of phyllo dough
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 scallions
- two 10-ounce bags of spinach
- salt and pepper
- 2 eggs
- 6 ounces feta cheese (1 1/2 cups crumbled)
- 1 teaspoon dried dill
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 4 tablespoons butter

### Directions

1. Remove phyllo from freezer. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Put olive oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over low heat. Trim and chop the scallions and spinach.
1. Raise the heat to medium-high and add scallions and spinach, a handful at a time; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently until the spinach leaves are just wilted, 2 to 3 minutes after the last addition. 
1. Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and beat them.
1. Crumble 1 1/2 cups feta and add to the bowl. Add dill and nutmeg. Melt the butter.
1. Cut the phyllo into thin shreds. 
1. When the spinach is wilted, stir in the egg and feta mixture and sprinkle the shredded phyllo dough over the top. Drizzle the melted butter over the phyllo. 
1. Bake until the phyllo is crisp, about 30 minutes. Cut the pie into wedges and serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.

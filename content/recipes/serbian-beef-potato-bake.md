### Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 carrot, shredded
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1/2 tablespoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.
1. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the beef until evenly brown. Remove beef from skillet, reserving juices, and set aside. Mix in the olive oil, and saute the green pepper, onion, carrot, and celery until tender.
1. Return beef to the skillet, and season with paprika, salt, black pepper, red pepper, cinnamon, and cloves. Stir in the water and red wine until heated through. Dissolve the beef bouillon cube into the mixture. Remove skillet from heat, and mix in the half-and-half.

1. Cook, covered, 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the potatoes are tender.

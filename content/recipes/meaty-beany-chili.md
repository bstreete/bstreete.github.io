### Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 yellow onion, diced medium
- 1 green pepper, seeded, diced medium
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 jalapenos, thinly sliced (seeded, if you want it less - spicy)
- 3 to 4 tablespoons mild chili powder
- 1 tablespoon dried mexican oregano
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- Several dashes fresh black pepper
- 1/8th teaspoon ground cloves
- 2 cups water (plus extra as needed) - stock is an acceptable substitute
- 1 cup dried brown lentils
- 1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes
- 1 1/2 cups cooked kidney beans, rinsed and drained (15 oz - can)
- 1 1/2 cups cooked black beans, rinsed and drained (15 oz - can)
- 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons lime juice

### Directions
1.	Set your slow cooker to “sear.”Saute the onion, green pepper and jalapeno in the oil with a big pinch of salt for 5 to 7 minutes, until onion is translucent.
2.	Add the garlic, and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add remaining ingredients, cover and set to slow cook for at least 8 hours. Lentils should be very tender.
3.	Taste for salt and seasoning, and thin with a little water if necessary.

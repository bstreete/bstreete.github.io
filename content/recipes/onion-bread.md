### Ingredients
- 2 packages active dry yeast
- 2 cups warm water
- 1 envelope onion soup mix
- 1/3 c sugar
- 2 tbsp molasses
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 egg
- 1/3 c soft shortening
- 6 to 6 1/2 c flour (not self-rising)

### Directions
1. In mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add soup mix, stir to dissolve completely.
1. Add remaining ingredients, but only half of the flour. Beat with a spoon until smooth.
1. Mix in enough remaining flour until dough handles easily. Turn onto a lightly floured board. Knead until smooth (about 10 minutes).
1. Place in greased bowl, turning once to bring greased side up. Cover with cloth, let rise (in warm place - 85 degrees) until double, about 1 hour.
1. Divide dough in half. Divide each half into 3 equal parts and roll into a 14" strnd. Place on a greased baking sheet, braid loosely, fasten ends and tuck under securely. Brush with butter and cover with cloth. Let it rise until it doubles, about 40 to 50 minutes.
1. Bake in oven at 375 degrees 25 to 30 minutes. Makes two braids.

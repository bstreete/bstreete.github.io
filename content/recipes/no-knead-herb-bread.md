### Ingredients
- 3 c all purpose flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 (2 1/2 tsp) package active dry yeast
- 1 1/4 c warm water
- 2 tbsp shortening or softened butter
- 3 tsp dried sage
- 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
- 1/4 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp melted butter

### Directions
1. Combine 2 cups flour, salt, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. Stir in the water, shortening, sage, rosemary, and thyme. Use an electric mixer to beat on low speed for 1 minute, scraping bowl frequently. Turn mixer to medium, and beat for an additional minute, scraping bowl frequently. Stir in remaining 1 cup flour, mix until smooth. Scrape batter from sides of bowl. Cover, and let rise in warm place for 35 to 40 minutes.
1. Grease a 9x5 loaf pan. Stir down batter by beating about 25 strokes. Scrape batter into greased pan, pat down with floured hands. Cover pan. Let dough rise in warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Do not allow dough to over-rise.
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
1. Bake in preheated oven until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, 40 to 45 minutes. Brush top with butter. Remove from pan, and cool on wire rack.

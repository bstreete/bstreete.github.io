I was unsuccessful regenerating the Nikola website on a Windows 11 box. 
I followed the startup guide and installed dependencies. 
I ended up with a slightly different version of each tool, but I didn't think it would be fatal. 

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Brayden\repos\recipes> python --version
Python 3.13.3
[2025-12-20 07:44:45] INFO: Nikola: Did you mean "version"?
PS C:\Users\Brayden\repos\recipes> ..\nikola-env\Scripts\nikola.exe --version 
Nikola v8.3.3
PS C:\Users\Brayden\repos\recipes> asciidoctor --version
Asciidoctor 2.0.26 [https://asciidoctor.org]
Runtime Environment (ruby 3.2.2 (2023-03-30 revision e51014f9c0) [x64-mingw-ucrt]) (lc:IBM437 fs:UTF-8 in:UTF-8 ex:UTF-8)
```

Every attempt to regenerate the site raised the following error before I added any new posts.

```powershell
..\nikola-env\Scripts\nikola.exe build
Scanning posts......done!
[2025-12-20 07:44:12] ERROR: Nikola: Error loading tasks. An unhandled exception occurred.

``` 

The `./cache` and `./output` directories did not contain any generated output. 
I only see CSS and images copied over. 
Running as an administrator didn't fix anything either.
I didn't see any security actions taken by antivirus. 
Googling for Windows specific issues against Nikola did not bring up any obvious fixes.

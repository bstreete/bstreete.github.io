I've got an old laptop I was using to play around with https://www.home-assistant.io/[Home Assistant]. 
I started with a clean install of Ubuntu desktop, but I realized I didn't need the desktop. 
I followed this https://askubuntu.com/questions/1313733/convert-ubuntu-desktop-to-server-edition-20-04[Ask Ubuntu] post to install the server version (CLI only). 

```bash
sudo apt install ubuntu-server

# I got a failure message: 
E: Failed to fetch http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/landscape-client/landscape-common_24.02-0ubuntu5.6_amd64.deb  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.91.83 80]
E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?

# I ran both suggestions: 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install ubuntu-server --fix-missing
sudo reboot
```

After the reboot, I set the default boot version to the server edition. 

```bash
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
sudo reboot
```

After moving over to the server edition, I removed the remaining packages and updated remaining packages. 
```bash
sudo apt purge ubuntu-desktop -y && sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt autoclean
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo reboot
```

After the final reboot: 
```bash
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-78-generic x86_64)

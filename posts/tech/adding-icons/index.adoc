I spent this afternoon creating and adding a favicon and logo to the webpage. 
The original inspiration was to print out some QR codes with a snazzy logo. 
I used https://www.canva.com/[Canva] to create a simple logo using some of their software engineering templates. 
I made a simpler version of the icon to use as a favicon for the webpage. 

After downloading the PNGs, I opened the images in https://www.gimp.org/[GIMP]. 
I added a transparent layer to the image, then deleted the outside white sections of the image to get the desired shapes. 

.Adding favicon and Logo to conf.py
```python
FAVICONS = (
    ("icon", "/favicon.png", "40x40"),
)

# Note: I used the {SITE_URL} to provide an absolute path, I had issues with relative 
# pathing on non-root level pages.
LOGO_URL = f'{SITE_URL}/images/main_logo.png'
```

After adding the new images, I noticed the logo placement was wonky. 
The current template I'm using expects a banner style logo across the top of the page. 
Since I wanted a smaller round logo, that didn't quite fit correctly. 
I modified the `base.tmpl` to move the logo around a little bit: 

.Removing the Logo from the Header
```html
<!-- Was -->
<div class="logo">
    {% if logo_url %}
        <img src="{{ logo_url }}" alt="{{ blog_title|e }}" id="logo">
    {% else %}
        <div id="nologoimage">
            {{ blog_title }}
        </div>
    {% endif %}
</div>

<!-- Is -->
<div class="logo">
    {% if logo_url %}
        {{ blog_title }}
    {% else %}
        <div id="nologoimage">
            {{ blog_title }}
        </div>
    {% endif %}
</div>
```

.Adding the Logo to the Nav Bar
```html
<!-- Was -->
<a href="/">
    <div id="titleauth">
        {% if show_blog_title %}
            {{ blog_title }}<br /> by {{ blog_author }}
        {% else %}
            by {{ blog_author }}
        {% endif %}
    </div>
</a>

<!-- Is -->
<a href="/">
    <div id="titleauth">
        {% if show_blog_title %}
            {{ blog_title }}<br /> by {{ blog_author }}
        {% else %}
            <img src="{{ logo_url }}" alt="{{ blog_title|e }}" id="logo">
        {% endif %}
    </div>
</a>
```

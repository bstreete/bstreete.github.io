Notes:
Makes about 10-15 cookies. Can be doubled or tripled easily. If coconut sugar is not available, granulated or raw sugar will both work.

## Directions

. In a large bowl, mix together ***cooled*** coconut oil, coconut sugar, molasses, egg, and vanilla extract. ***Seriously, make sure the coconut oil is cooled!***
. Add almond flour, coconut flour, basking soda, spices, and salt. Mix well to combine and form a dough. Rest for just a few minutes.
. Scoop a heaping tablespoon of dough, then roll between your hands to form a ball. Roll the ball in the extra sugar, if desired, then place on ungreased, papered baking sheet.
. Using your hand or the bottom of a glass, gently flatten each cookie. Bake for 8-11 minutes.
. Allow cookies to cool on cookie sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.

## Ingredients

### For Gnocchi
[cols="<,<"]
|===
| 1 small butternut squash, about 1 to 1-1/2 pounds
| 1 egg
| 1-1/2 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for the work surface
| 1/2 freshly grated Parmesan cheese
| salt and freshly ground pepper (about 1 rounded tsp and 1/2 tsp respectively)
|===

### For Spinach Sauce (Optional)
[cols="<,<"]
|===
| 1/2 pound fresh spinach
| 2 tablespoons minced onion
| 2 tablespoons butter, divided
| 1/4 cup white wine (I actually substituted Pom Juice since I didn't have a bottle of wine open. It worked great!)
| 1/2 cup beef stock
| 1 tablespoon cream (I used half & half)
| salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
| freshly grated nutmeg
|===

### Optional Toppings
* 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
* 6 tablespoons butter, melted and lightly browned (beurre noisette)

## Directions

### Gnocchi Directions
. Preheat the oven to 400F. 
Place the squash on a baking sheet and pierce with a sharp knife in several places. 
Bake for about 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until a knife can be inserted easily. 
Allow the squash to cool until easy to handle and cut it in half. 
Remove the seeds and fiber and scoop out the flesh with a large spoon and force it through a potato ricer. 
You will need about 1 packed cup of riced squash. 
Alternately, you can place the flesh in a food processor until lightly pureed. 
You just don't want any lumps. 
*At this point, I placed the squash in a fine-meshed strainer over a bowl, covered and refrigerated it and allowed the excess moisture to drain out overnight.*
. Mix the riced or pureed and strained squash with the egg, flour, Parmesan, salt and pepper and work into a smooth dough. 
If the dough is still sticky, add a little more flour. 
Taking plum-sized pieces of dough, roll into a rope about 1/2 thick on a floured surface. 
With a knife, cut the rope into pieces about 1 inch wide. 
They will resemble a pillow. 
Dust with more flour, if necessary, to keep them from sticking together. 
Repeat with the rest of the dough.
I left the gnocchi in the pillow shape because they were a little too soft to roll into traditional gnocchi shapes on a gnocchi board or over a fork. 
I'm sure this is a result of the squash having more water content than gnocchi made with potatoes.
. Have a large bowl of ice water ready near your cooking area. 
Cook the gnocchi in batches in salted boiling water for about 5 minutes or until the gnocchi rise to the surface. 
Using a slotted spoon, remove the gnocchi when they are done and place in the bowl full of ice water to stop the cooking. 
(Or, instead of putting them in ice water, you can serve immediately). 
When all the gnocchi are cooked and chilled in the ice bath, drain and place in a bowl. 
*At this point, you can cover and refrigerate the gnocchi overnight.*
. In a sauté pan over medium heat, add the 6 tablespoons of butter (I used less) and allow it to brown lightly. 
Drain most of the butter into a pyrex dish leaving enough in the pan to saute the gnocchi. 
Add the already-cooled gnocchi and saute until heated through, adding more browned butter, if needed.

### Spinach Sauce Directions 
. Wash and trim the spinach. In a saute pan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of butter. Sauté the onion until softened. Add the spinach, toss and cook until wilted. Puree the spinach mixture in a food processor. Combine the pomegranate juice and meat stock in a sauce pan and bring to a boil. Reduce to about 1/2 cup. Add the spinach puree and bring back to a boil. Remove from heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and the cream. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Mix thoroughly and keep warm.
. Place the spinach sauce on a serving plate, add the sauteed gnocchi and drizzle the rest of the browned butter over the top. Add grated Parmesan and serve.

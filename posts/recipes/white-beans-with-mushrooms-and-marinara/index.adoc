## Ingredients
[cols="<,"]
|===
| 8 oz. mushrooms
| 2 Tbsp olive oil
| 1 pinch salt and pepper
| 2 cloves garlic
| 2 cups marinara (or more to your liking)
| 2 15oz. cans butter beans
| 1/2 tsp dried basil
| 1 pinch crushed red pepper
| 4 oz. mozzarella
|===

## Directions  

. Preheat the oven to 400ºF. 
Wash and slice the mushrooms. 
Add the mushrooms, olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper to a deep skillet. 
Sauté the mushrooms until they have wilted and all the moisture in the skillet has evaporated.
. While the mushrooms are sautéing, mince the garlic, drain and rinse the butter beans. 
Add the garlic to the skillet with the mushrooms and sauté for 2 minutes more.
. Add the rinsed butter beans, marinara, basil, and red pepper to the skillet. 
Stir everything to combine, then allow it to heat through, stirring occasionally.
. While the skillet is heating through, shred the mozzarella. 
Top the skillet with the mozzarella, then cover the skillet with foil. 
Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.
. Once the cheese has melted, remove the foil, switch the oven to broil, and broil the skillet for a few minutes more to brown the cheese (watch closely, as browning can happen quickly with the broiler). 
Serve hot, with garlic bread for dipping!

### Notes

* If you don't have an oven safe skillet, simply transfer the beans, mushrooms, and marinara to a casserole dish before baking with the cheese.

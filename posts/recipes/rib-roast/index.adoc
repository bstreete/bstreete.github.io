## Ingredients

[cols="<,<"]
|===
| 2 pounds cross-rib roast
| 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
| 2 tablespoons minced garlic
| 2 teaspoons dried thyme
| 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
| 1 tablespoon salt
| 1 teaspoon pepper
| 1 tablespoon olive oil

|===

## Directions
. Brush roast with balsamic vinegar. 
. Make a paste with remaining ingredients and apply to meat.
. Roast meat at 450 for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 and cook for 40 to 60 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 125. 
. Remove from oven; cover loosely with foil and let stand 15 to 25 minutes. 

Note: This results in a well done roast. For a more rare roast, cook until an internal temp of 120.

## Directions
. Cream butter, sugar and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand 1. mixer on medium speed for about 2 minutes. 
. Add eggs, vanilla and lemon juice, blending with mixer on low 1. speed for 30 seconds, then medium speed for about 2 minutes, or 1. until light and fluffy, scraping down bowl. 
. With mixer on low speed, add flour, oats, baking soda, salt and 1. cinnamon, blending for about 45 seconds. Don’t overmix. 
. Remove bowl from mixer and stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.
. Portion dough with a scoop (about 3 tablespoons) onto a baking 1. sheet lined with parchment paper about 2 inches apart. 
. Preheat oven to 300°F. Bake for 20 to 23 minutes, or until 1. edges are golden brown and center is still soft. 
. Remove from oven and cool on baking sheet for about 1 hour.

**Cook’s note:** You can freeze the unbaked cookies, and there’s no need to thaw. Preheat oven to 300°F and place frozen cookies on parchment paper-lined baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake until edges are golden brown and center is still soft.

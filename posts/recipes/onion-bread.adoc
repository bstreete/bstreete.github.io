## Ingredients

[cols="<,<"]
|===
| 2 packages active dry yeast
| 2 cups warm water
| 1 envelope onion soup mix
| 1/3 c sugar
| 2 tbsp molasses
| 1 tsp salt
| 1 egg
| 1/3 c soft shortening
| 6 to 6 1/2 c flour (not self-rising)
|
|===

## Directions
. In mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add soup mix, stir to dissolve completely.
. Add remaining ingredients, but only half of the flour. Beat with a spoon until smooth.
. Mix in enough remaining flour until dough handles easily. Turn onto a lightly floured board. Knead until smooth (about 10 minutes).
. Place in greased bowl, turning once to bring greased side up. Cover with cloth, let rise (in warm place - 85 degrees) until double, about 1 hour.
. Divide dough in half. Divide each half into 3 equal parts and roll into a 14 strand. Place on a greased baking sheet, braid loosely, fasten ends and tuck under securely. Brush with butter and cover with cloth. Let it rise until it doubles, about 40 to 50 minutes.
. Bake in oven at 375 degrees 25 to 30 minutes. Makes two braids.

. Crumble in 1/2 cup unsalted butter with your fingers until the mixture is fragrant with butter, caraway and flour, and pieces of butter are pea-size or larger.
. In a second bowl, mix together 1 1/3 cups whole buttermilk, 1 egg and 1 teaspoon baking soda. 
Beat until foamy.
. Add to dry ingredients and combine to make a stiff dough, stopping just when flour disappears.

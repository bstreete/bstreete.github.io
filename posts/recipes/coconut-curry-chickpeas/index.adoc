## Ingredients
[cols="<,<"]
|===
| 1 yellow onion
| 2 cloves garlic
| 1 tsp grated fresh ginger
| 2 Tbsp olive oil
| 1.5 Tbsp curry powder
| 1 tsp cumin
| 2 15oz. cans chickpeas, drained
| 1 8oz. can tomato sauce
| 1 13.5oz. can full-fat coconut milk
| 4 oz. chopped kale (about 3 cups)
|===

## Directions 

. Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger.
Add the onion, garlic, and ginger to a large deep skillet along with the olive oil. 
Sauté the aromatics over medium-low heat for about five minutes, or until the onions are soft and translucent.
. Add the curry powder and cumin to the skillet and continue to stir and cook for about one minute more to toast the spices.
. Drain the chickpeas, then add them to the skillet along with the tomato sauce and coconut milk. 
Stir everything to combine.
. Turn the heat up to medium-high to bring the sauce up to a simmer.
Once simmering, turn the heat back down to medium-low and allow the curry to continue to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
. Add the kale and stir it into the sauce. 
Continue to cook and stir until the kale has wilted to your desired tenderness (I cook for about 5 minutes more). 
Finally, taste the curry and add salt to taste (about ½ tsp). 
Serve hot with rice or bread for dipping!

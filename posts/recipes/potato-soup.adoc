[cols="<,<"]
|===

| 4 strips bacon, diced
| 2 cups chopped yellow onion
| 1/4 cup minced shallot
| 1 tablespoon minced garlic
| 2 1/2 pounds Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice, reserved in a bowl of cold water
| 5 cups chicken stock or canned, low-sodium chicken broth
| 3/4 teaspoon salt
| 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
| 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more for garnish
| 1/2 cup heavy cream
| 2 tablespoons chopped green onion tops, plus more for garnish
| 8 ounces grated sharp Cheddar, for garnish (recommend doubling)

Note: Can use broccoli instead of bacon, and olive oil instead of bacon grease for a lighter soup.

## Directions
. In a heavy large saucepan or small Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until it has rendered most of its fat and begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, shallot, and garlic and cook until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes and add them to the pot along with the chicken stock, salt, white pepper and black pepper. Bring the liquid up to a simmer and then partially cover the pot and reduce the heat so that the soup remains at a slow simmer. Cook until the potatoes are tender, 30 to 45 minutes.
. Stir in the heavy cream and green onions and adjust the seasoning if necessary.
. Serve the soup in bowls garnished with the Cheddar and sprinkled with more green onion tops and black pepper if desired.

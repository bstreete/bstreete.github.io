## Ingredients  
[cols="<,<"]
|===
| 1 cup warm water
| ⅓ cup vegetable oil
| ¼ cup granulated sugar
| 2 tablespoons active dry yeast
| 1 large egg beaten
| 1 tablespoon unsalted butter softened
| 1 teaspoon salt
| 3 to 4 cups all-purpose flour
| ⅛ cup milk room temperature
|===

### Notes 

* If baking in a 9x13 pan, I make 15 rolls.
* If baking in a 10x15 pan, I make 18 rolls.

## Directions 

. Preheat oven to 400*F.
. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup water, oil, sugar, and yeast. 
Let sit until yeast is bubbly (about 8 minutes). 
Stir in beaten egg, softened butter, and salt.
. With a stand mixer or by hand, add flour, one cup at a time until you have a soft dough that isn’t sticky. 
Knead by hand 10 minutes or 5 minutes with a stand mixer.
. Divide dough into 18 even pieces, and form into balls. 
Place in a greased pan and cover with parchment paper and a kitchen towel.
. Let rise 10 minutes in a warm place. 
(You can allow them to rise up to an additional 30 minutes if time allows).
. Lightly brush with milk and bake on the middle rack for 10-12 minutes or just until browned.

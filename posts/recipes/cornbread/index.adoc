#### Notes
This is a modified version of the original recipe. The chili recipe associated with the cornbread was omitted as I prefer a [different chili recipe](../meaty-beany-chili). The cornbread is quite tasty, but can be cooked independently. 

Cornbread goes great with honey and/or butter.

[cols="<,<"]
|===
| 1 cup yellow cornmeal

## Directions

Instructions

. Begin to preheat the oven to 425ºF. In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until very well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and oil. Pour the milk mixture into the bowl with the cornmeal mixture and stir just until everything is moistened.
. Pour the mixture into the oiled skillet. 
. Transfer the skillet to the fully preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes, or until the cornbread is golden brown on the surface.

## Ingredients

[cols="<,<"]
|===
| 1 pre-cooked ham, ~7-9 lbs
| 2 L Coca-Cola
| 2 L ginger ale (__not__ diet)
| 1 large can pineapple juice or concentrate (~1 L) 
| 1 large chunk ginger root, peeled and sliced
| dijon-style mustard
| maraschino cherries
| whole pineapple rings
| whole cloves
| {empty}
|===

## Directions

. Place ham in large stockpot. 
Add Coca-Cola, ginger ale, and ~3/4 of the pineapple juice until ham is fully submerged.
. Bring to a boil.
. Reduce heat to a simmer, continue cooking for 2-3 hours.
. Turn off heat, cover pot, and let sit overnight (approximately 6 hours).
. Preheat oven to 350 F. 
Remove ham from liquid and drain. 
. Make glaze by combining mustard, remaining pineapple juice, brown sugar, and dry mustard. 
Mix until dry mustard is well incorporated and brown sugar is dissolved.
. Score ham in a grid across fatty sections. 
Place cloves into score marks. 
. Decorate ham with pineapple rings and cherries. 
Brush glaze over ham & fruit. 
. Bake ham for 1 1/2 hours (bone-in), brushing with glaze periodically. 
This is basically to bring the hame back up to  temperature, so you may need less time for a boneless ham.

## Ingredients

[cols="<,<"]
|===
| 1 pound sweet potatoes (about 2 medium), peeled and coarsely grated
| 2 scallions, finely chopped
| 1/3 cup all-purpose flour

## Directions
. Wash hands with soap and warm water. Wash produce well and chop as directed. 
. Stir together all ingredients, except oil, until well mixed.
. Heat a small amount of oil in a deep nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Spoon 2 tablespoons of potato mixture per pancake onto hot oiled pan and flatten to 3-inch diameter with a spatula.
. Reduce heat to medium and cook until golden, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. 
. Transfer pancakes with spatula to paper towels to drain. 
. Repeat with remaining mixture. Serve hot and enjoy!

Note: Substitute the sweet potatoes for regular potatoes, carrots, or zucchini. 

Makes roughly 12 pancakes.

## Directions
### Salad

. In a large bowl, combine kale, nuts, dried fruit, and cheese.
. Toss salad with mustard vinaigrette. 
. Serve immediately or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days. 

### Mustard Vinaigrette Dressing
. Combine all ingredients in a clean jar (like a mason jar or spaghetti sauce jar). Place lid on jar and shake vigorously until ingredients are well combined.

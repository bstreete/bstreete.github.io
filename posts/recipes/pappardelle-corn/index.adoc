## Ingredients

[cols="<,<"]
|===
| Kosher salt
| 2 ears corn, shucked
| 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
| 3 cups grape tomatoes
| 2 cloves garlic, minced
| Freshly ground pepper
| 1/2 cup white wine
| 12 ounces pappardelle pasta
| 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
| 1 small bunch scallions, thinly sliced
| 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan, plus more for topping
| Torn basil, for topping

|===

## Directions
. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the corn and cook until slightly tender, about 3 minutes. Remove with tongs, reserving the boiling water. Let the corn cool slightly, then cut off the kernels.
. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the tomatoes, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook until the tomatoes soften, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 more minute. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
. Meanwhile, cook the pappardelle in the corn water as the label directs. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water, then drain the pasta. Add the chicken broth and corn kernels to the skillet and bring to a simmer.
. Add the pasta to the skillet; add the scallions, parmesan, the remaining 3 tablespoons butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Toss to combine, adding the reserved cooking water as needed. Season with salt and pepper. Top with more parmesan and basil.

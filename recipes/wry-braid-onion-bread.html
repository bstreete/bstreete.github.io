			<h2> Directions </h2>

			<ol>
				<li> In mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add soup mix, stir to dissolve completely. </li>
				<li> Add remaining ingredients, but only half of the flour. Beat with a spoon until smooth.  </li>
				<li> Mix in enough remaining flour until dough handles easily. Turn onto a lightly floured board. Knead until smooth (about 10 minutes).  </li>
				<li> Place in greased bowl, turning once to bring greased side up. Cover with cloth, let rise (in warm place - 85 degrees) until double, about 1 hour.  </li>
				<li> Divide dough in half. Divide each half into 3 equal parts and roll into a 14" strnd. Place on a greased baking sheet, braid loosely, fasten ends and tuck under securely. Brush with butter and cover with cloth. Let it rise until it doubles, about 40 to 50 minutes.  </li>
				<li> Bake in oven at 375 degrees 25 to 30 minutes. Makes two braids.  </li>
